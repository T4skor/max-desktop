Description: set of tools useful for working with people with disabilities
 AraSuite is a set of tools (previously as separate projects: AraWord,
 TICO, AraBoard...) useful for working with people with disabilities,
 particularly those related with communication. That requires the use
 of aumentative and adaptative communication systems that combine
 pictograms and words as related concepts.
