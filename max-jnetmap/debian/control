Description: Graphical network monitoring and documentation tool
 jNetMap is a network monitoring and documentation tool.
 It will (with some help from you) draw a representation of the network.
 It pings all registered devices every x minutes, updating their
 status according to the result of the ping. Alternatively you can also
 monitor a specific port, such as port 80 for webservers.
 Available devices are green, unavailable devices are red.
